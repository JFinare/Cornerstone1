<h1>High Forest's Sylvan Unity</h1>
<hr/>
<p>A chronicle unfolds as the once-slumbering Treants joined forces with woodland brethren in the High Forest. 
    Elves, gnomes, firbolgs, centaurs, Ghostandians, and a Dragon unite to protect their Ancestral Woodlands.</p>

<p>This unprecedented coalition has sent shockwaves 
    through the lumber and shipping industry of neighbouring settlements. Logging activities have dwindled across 
    The High Forest & Southwood, as the guardians challenge practices that jeopardize their birthplace.</p>
<p>While our borders are mostly undisturbed by loggers, the Council is keeping a close eye on the situation in case the 
    loggers would look to our forest as a source of lumber.
