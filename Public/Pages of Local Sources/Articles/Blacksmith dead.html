<h1>Beloved Local Blacksmith, Rovan Smeets, Passed Away Mysteriously</h1>
<hr/>

<h4>Rovan was found dead in the morning of the 11th day of Mirtul. May he rest in peace.<br/>
</h4>
<p>While he passed seemingly peacefully, his closest friends put the blame on another Citizen  of Secomber. 
Investigators of the law have not ruled out that Rovan's demise was the result of a criminal act.
</p>
<p><em>A messenger has been sent to inform Rovan's son who is now the sole inheritor of his business and property.</em></p>
<p>
He was found in his bed in the later hours of the Morning without visible injuries. However 
many are confused with the circumstances, as his forge was already lit before abruptly extinguished.
Many reported that they tried to visit his shop, but received no response despite being open. Later however
some worried customers entered the house and searched for him when the smoke rose from the forge.
</p>
<p>
    His friends reported another citizen as a suspect for his ill demise, however said person 
    disappeared the same morning from their lodgings, arousing even further suspicions.
    <br/>
    The mentioned suspect had close relations with Rovan and was recently visited by their daughter whose whereabouts are also unknown.
    <br/>Law enforcement sent note to neighbouring councils and are searching the pair for questioning.

<h4>What the local have to say about this:</h4>
<p><b>Mr. G.Stoneglow</b><br/>
    "The three of them visited my inn the night before. The young girl asked me for my help, she said
    Rovan and the suspect had some sort of argument, but given their history together I didn't think much of it.
    It pains me to think I could have done something to avoid this tragedy. But I honestly can not believe that
    the suspect or the girl had any hand in his passing."
</p>
<p><b>Mr. A.Mihal</b><br/>
    "Rovan told me and the pals that the girl's trouble later that night. He drank some ale but was not drunk, I believe him.
    I think the suspect was roused by the girl to take poor Rovan's life, they need to be found and brought to justice!"

</p>
<p><b>Mrs. L.Andres</b><br/>
    "I went to pick up the order he prepared for me but he was not in the courtyard, I heard something break, like glass or some ceramics from upstairs and someone talking,
    so I figured he is busy and it would be better to come back around thulsun. I am so afraid now, I could have been just a few yards from a killer!"</p>
