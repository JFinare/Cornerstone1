    <h1>Union Disrupts Lumber Industry in Noble Quest to Protect Ancestral Woods</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In a momentous alliance born of an unwavering commitment to the preservation of their home, 
previously slumbering <b>Treants</b> seeked out their forest-dwelling comrades and joined forces 
to limit the destruction and exploitation of their Ancestral Woodlands.<br/>
The union now boost members of the local elves, gnomes, firbolgs, centaurs, Ghostandians and even a <em><b>Green Dragon</b></em> 
who recently made their lair in the heart of the forest.</p>
<p>
This unprecedented unity has not only galvanized their quest to protect the 
sanctity of their ancient woods but has also sent ripples through the lumber & shipping industry. The movement 
has seen the reduction in logging activities in many regions of The High Forest & Southwood, as these guardians 
of the forest challenge the practices that threaten their birthplace. 
As the Treants, spearheaded by the charismatic elves and wise firbolgs continue to 
make their voices heard, their noble endeavor shines as a beacon of hope for the woods they love and 
for Faerun's delicate ecosystems, reminding all that nature's guardians will stop at nothing to 
protect the heart of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Representatives from The Misty Forest have not yet made their voices heard regarding this union, however their borders are mostly 
    undisturbed by loggers.
